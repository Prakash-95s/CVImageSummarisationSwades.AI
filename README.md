API for CV image summarization(backend)

    Ensure you install all libraries given in pip install in .ipynb
    Do run all the cells in this app
    Finally get the generated public URL of ngrok server from the last running cell to be used as the Post APIin react app
    Use GPU cuda or T4 or L4 GPU for running the cells.(For NLP only high machinery H-100s required)

React App image -summarization

 install necessary libraries if not exist like
npm axios
npm react-load-spinner
Finally give NPM start to start server on localhost://3000 it will ask other port if the port is busy with NLP app
please make sure in imageupload.js change the public url of Generated ngrok every time you rerun the backend API.
